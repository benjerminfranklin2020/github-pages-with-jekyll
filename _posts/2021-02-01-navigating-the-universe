Churchill Capital Corp. IV engages in operation of a blank check firm. The firm was formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. The company was founded by Michael Klein and is headquartered in New York, NY.

The recent SPAC craze has attracted a wide variety of investors during the past year and ticker: CCIV is no exception. With the possibility of a merger with Lucid Motors (https://www.lucidmotors.com/) to bring the company public, speculators are licking their chops in an anticipation.

Recent developments being discussed on Twitter and Reddit have augmented the promise for this merger to become official. According to one such tweet, Bloomberg Terminal has confirmed that the transaction for the acquisition was proposed on 1/14/2021

Strategy: Sell an out of the money vertical put spread with 25 and 35 strike prices and 18DTE. Look to take profits if CCIV pushes past $30.00 per share.
